## What I learned 
###### I have learned what GitHub is and what the different features that its composed of such as: 
- The different fonts (bolding/italics) **Italics**
- How to upload files and insert images using the URL technique
- How to request a pull request and commit files 
- how to comment and review changes 
- How to create a **repository** and make markdown cells/upload files 


*There was not anything I was particulary confused on*
